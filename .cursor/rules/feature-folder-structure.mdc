# Feature Folder Structure Rules

## Overview
All features must follow a consistent folder structure that separates concerns into dedicated directories. This promotes maintainability, scalability, and clear organization.

## Feature Location
- All features must be located in `src/pages/` or `src/features/` directory
- Each feature must have its own folder named in `PascalCase` (e.g., `Dashboard`, `PageEight`, `UserProfile`)

## Required Folder Structure

Each feature folder MUST contain the following structure:

```
FeatureName/
├── FeatureName.tsx          # Main feature/page component (entry point)
├── components/              # Feature-specific UI components
│   ├── FeatureComponent1.tsx
│   ├── FeatureComponent2.tsx
│   └── ...
├── hooks/                   # Feature-specific custom hooks
│   ├── useFeatureHook.ts
│   └── ...
├── types/                   # Feature-specific TypeScript types and interfaces
│   ├── feature.types.ts
│   └── ...
├── services/                # Feature-specific API calls and business logic
│   ├── featureService.ts
│   └── ...
├── utils/                   # Feature-specific utility functions (optional)
│   ├── featureUtils.ts
│   └── ...
├── constants/               # Feature-specific constants (optional)
│   ├── featureConstants.ts
│   └── ...
└── assets/                  # Feature-specific assets (images, SVGs, etc.) (optional)
    ├── feature-image.png
    └── ...
```

## Directory Rules

### 1. Main Feature File
- **Location**: `FeatureName/FeatureName.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main entry point component for the feature
- **Naming**: Must match the folder name in PascalCase
- **Exports**: Must export the main feature component as a named export

### 2. Components Directory
- **Location**: `FeatureName/components/`
- **Purpose**: All feature-specific UI components
- **Naming**: PascalCase with feature prefix (e.g., `DashboardNavbar.tsx`, `PageEightHero.tsx`)
- **Rules**:
  - One component per file
  - Components should be self-contained and reusable within the feature
  - Shared components used across multiple features should be in `src/components/`

### 3. Hooks Directory
- **Location**: `FeatureName/hooks/`
- **Purpose**: Feature-specific custom React hooks
- **Naming**: Must start with `use` prefix (e.g., `useFeatureData.ts`, `useFeatureState.ts`)
- **Rules**:
  - One hook per file
  - Hooks should be feature-specific
  - Shared hooks used across multiple features should be in `src/hooks/`

### 4. Types Directory
- **Location**: `FeatureName/types/`
- **Purpose**: TypeScript type definitions, interfaces, and enums specific to the feature
- **Naming**: Descriptive names with `.types.ts` suffix (e.g., `feature.types.ts`, `user.types.ts`)
- **Rules**:
  - Group related types in the same file
  - Export types that are used outside the feature
  - Avoid inline type definitions in component files when types are reused

### 5. Services Directory
- **Location**: `FeatureName/services/`
- **Purpose**: API calls, data fetching, and business logic specific to the feature
- **Naming**: Descriptive names with `Service` suffix (e.g., `featureService.ts`, `userService.ts`)
- **Rules**:
  - One service per file or domain
  - Services should handle all external API calls for the feature
  - Shared services used across multiple features should be in `src/services/`

### 6. Utils Directory (Optional)
- **Location**: `FeatureName/utils/`
- **Purpose**: Feature-specific utility functions and helpers
- **Naming**: Descriptive names with `Utils` suffix (e.g., `featureUtils.ts`, `formatUtils.ts`)
- **Rules**:
  - Only include utilities specific to this feature
  - Shared utilities should be in `src/utils/`

### 7. Constants Directory (Optional)
- **Location**: `FeatureName/constants/`
- **Purpose**: Feature-specific constants, configuration values, and enums
- **Naming**: Descriptive names with `Constants` suffix (e.g., `featureConstants.ts`)
- **Rules**:
  - Only include constants specific to this feature
  - Shared constants should be in `src/constants/`

### 8. Assets Directory (Optional)
- **Location**: `FeatureName/assets/`
- **Purpose**: Feature-specific images, SVGs, fonts, and other static assets
- **Rules**:
  - Use clear, descriptive names for assets
  - Shared assets should be in `src/assets/` or `public/`

## Import Rules

### Internal Feature Imports
- Import from feature subdirectories using relative paths:
  ```typescript
  import { FeatureComponent } from './components/FeatureComponent'
  import { useFeatureHook } from './hooks/useFeatureHook'
  import type { FeatureType } from './types/feature.types'
  import { featureService } from './services/featureService'
  ```

### Cross-Feature Imports
- Import shared resources from root-level directories:
  ```typescript
  import { SharedComponent } from '../../components/SharedComponent'
  import { useSharedHook } from '../../hooks/useSharedHook'
  import { sharedService } from '../../services/sharedService'
  ```

### Type Imports
- Always use `import type` for type-only imports:
  ```typescript
  import type { FeatureType } from './types/feature.types'
  ```

## File Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `DashboardNavbar.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useFeatureData.ts`)
- **Types**: camelCase with `.types.ts` suffix (e.g., `feature.types.ts`)
- **Services**: camelCase with `Service` suffix (e.g., `featureService.ts`)
- **Utils**: camelCase with `Utils` suffix (e.g., `featureUtils.ts`)
- **Constants**: camelCase with `Constants` suffix (e.g., `featureConstants.ts`)

## Migration Guidelines

When refactoring existing features:
1. Create the new folder structure
2. Move components to `components/` directory
3. Extract types to `types/` directory
4. Move feature-specific hooks to `hooks/` directory
5. Move feature-specific services to `services/` directory
6. Update all import paths
7. Ensure no shared resources are moved (keep them in root-level directories)

## Examples

### Good Structure
```
src/pages/Dashboard/
├── DashboardPage.tsx
├── components/
│   ├── DashboardNavbar.tsx
│   ├── DashboardSummarySection.tsx
│   └── DashboardPerformanceCharts.tsx
├── hooks/
│   └── useDashboardData.ts
├── types/
│   └── dashboard.types.ts
└── services/
    └── dashboardService.ts
```

### Bad Structure (Avoid)
```
src/pages/Dashboard/
├── DashboardPage.tsx
├── DashboardNavbar.tsx          # ❌ Component not in components/
├── dashboardTypes.ts            # ❌ Types not in types/
└── dashboardService.ts          # ❌ Service not in services/
```

## Enforcement

- Cursor will suggest folder structure corrections when creating new features
- When adding new files to a feature, ensure they are placed in the correct subdirectory
- Refactor existing features to match this structure when making significant changes
